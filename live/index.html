		<p>i started my morning with a walk in the forest. there are trees all around so it wasn't difficult to find. it's easy here to wake up and go somewhere. the wifi here only exists in one room and that i'm very happy about. </p>
		<p>only in the morning it has been more possible to grasp where i am, though still quite impossible. it's a compound of 2 buildings and a little church. very very tiny, the size of a shed. when we arrived Jacopo told me that they call this place (Ca' de Monti) a village because there's a church</p>
		<p>it was so great to read Jacopo's thesis alongside having some coffee on the terrace. the urge for a space lke this was born in his head. i learned that Ca' de Monti translated literally means house of a mountain and there were many things which i wanted to underline and i'll do that as soon as he confirms i can keep this copy</p>
		<p>i was playing my little pocket operator today before lunch and i want to try to connect it to the speakers later</p>
		<p>here i feel like a lot of feelings, thoughts, ideas of things are coming together. i can remember looking for a place like this a long time ago</p>
		<p>this day has very much revolved around flies or they around us. there is one trying ot get into my hair right now</p>
		<p>there is a telescope </p>
		<p>Poni, Pongie (Jacopo) and Lorenzo will go get some wood later for the fire. i tell them i want to go with and they tell me there is a man with a permanent cigarette in his mouth who helps them gather and cut the wood</p>
		<p>we went for a 45 minute walk, but it was way longer. there are many mushrooms on the paths that i haven't seen before. andrea told me he brought a book with him about plants that he will study later for the next walk</p>
		<p>everyone listens to amazing music here</p>
		<p>on the walk friendly faces tell me there will be a rap battle and a tattooing session tonight. they ask me if i ever tried tattooing and they say they have some fields of practice on their skin, where other people have done their first tries at getting ink under skin</p>
		<p>cooking seems to be ingrown in everyone's genes here</p>
		<p>the queen of the house is Birbi (i'm not sure that's actually how you spell it), i always call here as brb. come back brb</p>

		<p>i got off the bologna airport bus and cried from happiness. it was warm and sunny and my skin didn't expect that</p>
		<p>in a park, a crow crowing while sitting on a thin branch of a tree. the whole body of the bird moves with every croaking call</p>
		<p>a teenage couple making out intensely on a park bench. i guess italiano style</p>
		<p>one's own life becomes interesting when written down</p>
		<p>there is a fountain of turtles. Alejandro wrote a beautiful message to me about starts and ends and i'm feeling it next to the fountain of turtles</p>
		<p>i left the park with many bites. it's been a few months since i had another mosquito bite. then two mosquitos were mating in front of me. probably they were the ones that had a sweet bite of my blood</p>
		<p>walking through the streets of bologna, i see many places that i want to revisit. i try to remember them for when i come back. a nice cafe called baracca e burattini. that doesn't sound real.</p>
		<p>there is a festival called Robot in town and i'm wondering if i should just stay. Lyra Pramuk
		will play tomorrow</p>
		<p>this diary is born as a chain-reaction to a diary i am reading from greta</p>
		<p>i want to go to parco bucci in Faenza, a town i have to take the train to from Bologna. from Faenza i'll continue on to Tredozio and i'm not sure i'll have time for parco bucci, but i need to come back for it. apparently there are these peacocks there</p>
		<img src="./images/peacock.png" alt="a photo of a white-feathered peacock in park bucci">
		<p>i arrived at 18:30 and i started the trip at 6:30, so it took me 12 hours to go from Berlin to Ca' de Monti</p>
		<p>Jacopo picked me up in a car and we went up the mountain and finally came to a house i remember seeing in google maps. he showed me around, i can barely remember which room leads to which. he says i have to see the core of Habitat which is the people. we go downstairs towards music, there are a few friendly faces, two of them playng back to back on a dj deck. some really great music. the rest of the faces had apparently gone on a walk to a river</p>
		<p>Federico aka poni comes to say hello while i sit outside. i had previously seen him on a call on jitsi. he tells me about their trip to a river and that apparently they went to a small volcano. the smallest in europe. that apparently was a joke and it's not a real volcano, but something else. something to do with methane gas. could it be? i can't wait to see it</p>
		<p>they tell me they had a big pizza night yesterday, and that we will have locally picked mushrooms for dinner today and that a lot of talk here goes around food</p>
		<p>not all of the residents have arrived, so i have 2 days of properly arriving before the residency begins.</p>
		<p>dinner was so sweet and delicious.<br>many things connect here and it feels like this is a place i'd always wanted to be at</p>
